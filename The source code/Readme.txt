1. main1_ct.m: After running this file, a total of 7 pictures, namely Figs. 2-8, will be generated. 
Specifically, Fig. 2 illustrates the trajectory of the target and network topology structure. 
Fig. 3 depicts the target position and state estimate curves of twenty sensor nodes on the X-axis. Fig. 4 displays the velocity results on the X-axis.
Figs. 5 and 6 compare the average error covariance traces on position and velocity under the above four different cases, respectively. 
Figs. 7 and 8 show the MSEs of the proposed distributed state estimation on position and velocity with $T=500$ under the above four different cases, respectively.

2. main2_ct.m: After running this file, two pictures, Figs. 9-10, will be generated. 
Specifically, Figs. 9 and 10 analyze the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm under different sensing range constraints.

3. main3_ct.m: After running this file, Fig. 13 will be generated. 
Specifically, Fig. 13 discusses the relationships between the attack detection parameter $Z^i$ and the false rates, including the false positive (FP) rate and the false negative (FN) rate.

4. network_attack.m: After running this file, a graph structure diagram of a sensor network consisting of 20 sensor nodes distributed within a 100Ã—100 area will be generated.

5. network_attack.xlsx:  Provide the positions of the 20 sensor nodes that make up the sensor network in the plane.

Note: Simply open them one by one and run them on MATLAB.
